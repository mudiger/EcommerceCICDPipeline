# Ecommerce CI/CD Pipeline (https://ecommerce-cicd-pipeline.vercel.app/)
Ecommerce CI/CD Pipeline is a modern e-commerce frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript, showcasing a clean architecture and end-to-end automation through CI/CD. It features an interactive product browsing experience and deploys seamlessly using Vercel, making it a great base for scalable e-commerce solutions.

## Deployment Strategy
Originally, this project was configured to build and push Docker images to **AWS ECR** using GitHub Actions, then deploy containers using **AWS ECS / Fargate**. Here's what the CI/CD flow looked like:

1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds a Docker image
3. Image is pushed to AWS ECR
4. Containers were deployed on AWS infrastructure

However, due to AWS hosting costs, the deployment has been migrated to **Vercel**. You can still find the AWS GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/docker-push.yml`.

## ‚ö° Features
- Dynamic product listing pages and cart functionality
- Route-based navigation with search functionality
- Integrated CI/CD pipeline for streamlined deployment
